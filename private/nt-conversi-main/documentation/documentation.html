			<h1><span class="label color-02">02.14</span> Child Theme</h1>
			<h4>Why You Should Be Using Child Themes</h4>
			<p>Creating a child theme when performing adjustments to your theme’s code can save you a lot of future headache. Child themes allow you to make changes without affecting the original theme’s code, which makes it easy to update your parent theme without erasing your changes. By creating a child theme, you create a separate set of files that you can use to customize the theme without affecting the original theme at all. Not only does this make updating easier, it also makes sure that you will never ruin your original theme as you are never actually modifying the files. You can always turn off your child theme and fall back on the original.<a title="Increase Memory Limit" href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/wordpress-child-theme-tutorial" target="_blank"> Click Me To Create A Child Theme</a></p>

        <h1><span class="label color-01">13.1</span>Troubleshooting 101</h1>
        <p>Do you have a problem with your theme? This quick troubleshooting guide should be the first thing to check through - it will help you find the <strong>root cause</strong> of the issue.</p>
        <p>A WordPress website issue can come from mainly one of 4 areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conflicting plugins</li>
          <li>Broken WordPress install</li>
          <li>Incorrect server setup</li>
          <li>The theme itself</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lets find out where your issue is coming from!</p>
        <h3>Step 1: Check your plugins</h3>
        <p>The first thing to do is to see if you have any plugins installed. Do you? If so, go to your admin panel and disable all of them. Now, go back to your site and see if the issue remains. If the problem is gone, then re-activate your plugins one-by-one and check the site between each activation. This way you will directly find the plugin(s) that cause problems.</p>
        <p>If your issue remains even with all plugins disabled, go on to the next step.</p>
        <h3>Step 2: Check your customizations</h3>
        <p>Have you customized your theme in any way before you noticed the issue? If so, go to the theme demo website of the theme and see if you find the same issue there. If you can not see the issue there, you need to take a look at your customized code and find what may be wrong.</p>
        <h3>Step 3: Is the issue admin panel related?</h3>
        <p>If you have problems with media uploads, errors in the WordPress dashboard or other access issues, the likely cause is either an incorrectly setup server or a broken WordPress install.</p>
        <p>To see if your problem is related to a broken WordPress install or an incorrect server setup, simply activate a WordPress default theme such as Twenty Twelve. Does the issue remain? Then your issue is not theme related. If the issue goes away with a default theme active, then it's most likely theme related.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you think your issue is WordPress related? <strong>Re-installing WordPress</strong> may be a good idea, or asking for help on the <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/support/">wordpress.org forums</a>.</li>
          <li>Do you think your issue is server related? Try some <strong>Google-searching</strong> for the issue, or <strong>contact your server provider</strong> about it.</li>
          <li>Do you think the issue is coming from the theme? Make sure to read this documentation through. If the issue remains and you are certain it's coming from the theme, feel free to report the bug on the wordpress.org <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/support/theme/hueman">support forums for hueman</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Note: Remember cache!</h3>
        <p>If you apply/repair code to fix issues but see no changes on your website when you save it, check if your website has any cache plugin activated. If so, make sure to empty all caches. Also force-refresh the page when viewing it by pressing F5.</p>
